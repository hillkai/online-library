# online-library
This program mimics an online library. To start, the user picks if they want to login as a librarian or patron or if they just want to see 
the hours (in the file I provided the librarian login codes go from 100-190 incrementing by ten and the patron login codes go from 200-290 
incrementing by ten). Once the user logged on he/she can do a variety of things. A librarian can change library hours, add new or remove 
books from the database, view all the books currently checked out, and view if a specific book is checked out. A patron can check out a 
book, check in a book, view books he/she has checked out, view all books in library, or search the library database for a specific book 
by title, author, or year. 

This program uses file i/o and classes. The program explores the idea of have a versus uses a relationship with classes. For example a 
library has a librarian, but a librarian uses a cart. To run this program, use the makefile. Type make and then run the program in 
the terminal.
